# PIR-arduino-LED
This is the code that you need to turn on a LED using a sensor PIR. 
The LED is an RGB LED, so you need 3 output pins to turn it on. The led also have the function "random()" to turn on random colors.
The buzzer works using the function "tone(<buzzerPin>, <frecuency on Hertz>, <delay>). You can turn it off using "notTone(<buzzerPin>)".
Thats all.
